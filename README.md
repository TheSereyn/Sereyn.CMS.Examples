# Sereyn CMS Examples

Presently I have created a single blog style template that uses Sereyn CMS 0.1.0. The project shows how the system can be easily implemented into a Blazor WASM project.

Sereyn CMS is still very early in development, it's possible the current implementation could change a fair bit before I delare a version 1.0.0. More details can be found on the Sereyn CMS repo. 

# Running in a development environment

Two quick points to keep in mind when running this project on a local machine:
 - Content and Catalogue folders will need moving into the wwwroot folder. 
 - It's possible you may need to update the base URL Sereyn CMS uses in the appsettings.json file.

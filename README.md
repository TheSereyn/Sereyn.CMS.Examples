# Sereyn CMS Examples

Presently I have created a single blog style template that uses Sereyn CMS 0.1.0. The project shows how the system can be easily implemented into a Blazor WASM project.

Sereyn CMS is still very early in development, it's possible the current implementation could change a fair bit before I delare a version 1.0.0. More details can be found on the Sereyn CMS repo. 

## Running in a development environment

The only configuration needed for the app is to update the base URL that is used by Sereyn CMS in the appsettings.json file in the wwwroot folder.  

## Live Example

You can find a copy of the blog example at the following link.
